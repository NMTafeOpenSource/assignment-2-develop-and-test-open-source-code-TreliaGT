# OSStarterCode Assessment
This program is for assignment 2-3 of the Open Source and Testing course.
This repository contains a basic vehicle rental system which allows a user to add/remove, rent out and collect vehicles by a GUI form.

## Problem that Could Occur
The program using a Text file to keep the required information the vehicles needs to display in the GUI form. There is was an occurring program with the program and the text file where the txt becomes corrupted which causes the program to show up with no information of the Vehicles. We do believe that this problem has been fixed within the program but in case this problem does occur again. 
This is how to fix it:
1. Enter into the txt file saved within the src/test files
2. Remove the blank line below the text
3. Save the file.
4. Rerun the program.
Should work once these steps has been done.

## To Run
To run this application use an IDE for Java, I recommend NetBeans IDE 8.2 because the code was developed in NetBeans. 
When using Netbeans these are the steps to run this program.
1. Clone the project by pressing the green button that could say "Clone or Download".
2. Go into Netbeans and go into "file" on the top left of the page, then select "open project".
3. Navigate to where you have downloaded the program, enter into the file and you should be able to see something like a coffee cup.
4. Select the coffee cup file and click "Open Project" button. Should be able to see all of the files of the project on the left hand side
5. Select the project then click the run button which is located on the top, left of the screen next to the blue hammers icon. This Button    should look like a green play icon.
