# OSStarterCode Assessment
This program is for assignment 2-3 of the Open Source and Testing course.
This repository contains a basic vehicle rental system which allows a user to add/remove, rent out and rent in vehicles by a GUI form.

# Bug
The program using an Txt file to keep the required information the vehicles needs to display in the Gui form. This txt file at this time can become corrupted to fix this, you must go into the txt file and remove the blank line below the txt. 

# To Run
To run this application use an IDE for Java, I recommend NetBeans IDE 8.2 because the code was developed in NetBeans. 
On Netbeans you just need to select the file onced cloned from this github repository then press the green play button on the top of your screen.
